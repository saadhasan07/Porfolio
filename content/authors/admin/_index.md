    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a passionate DevOps & Cloud Engineer and Certified Scrum Master with a strong background in automating cloud deployments, building CI/CD pipelines, and implementing infrastructure as code. I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering scalable, reliable solutions using AWS, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. My experience spans full-stack web development, cloud-native architectures, and Agile team facilitation.

I believe in continuous improvement—both for technology and teams. My mission is to bridge the gap between development and operations, enabling organizations to innovate faster and more securely. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams, mentoring others, and keeping up with the latest in cloud and DevOps practices.

When I'm not coding or automating workflows, you'll find me playing football, swimming, or exploring new tech trends. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
