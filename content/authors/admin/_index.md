I am a passionate DevOps & Cloud Engineer and Certified Scrum Master with a strong background in automating cloud deployments, building CI/CD pipelines, and implementing infrastructure as code. I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering scalable, reliable solutions using AWS, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. My experience spans full-stack web development, cloud-native architectures, and Agile team facilitation.

I believe in continuous improvement—both for technology and teams. My mission is to bridge the gap between development and operations, enabling organizations to innovate faster and more securely. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams, mentoring others, and keeping up with the latest in cloud and DevOps practices.

When I'm not coding or automating workflows, you'll find me playing football, swimming, or exploring new tech trends. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
